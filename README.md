## Introduction

This repository contains a set of files and scripts to implement a data pipeline with Docker and PostgreSQL. The pipeline consists of data ingestion, running in Docker containers. The files include a Docker Compose configuration file for easy deployment and integration with other Docker tools, as well as scripts for data ingestion and database configuration. 


## Contents.

Introduction to Docker: explaining why Docker is needed and creating a simple data pipeline in Docker.

Ingesting New York Taxi data into PostgreSQL: demonstrated how to ingest New York Taxi data into a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container.

PostgreSQL and pgAdmin connection using Docker and Docker networking.

Putting the data ingestion script in a Docker container.

Running PostgreSQL and pgAdmin with Docker Compose.

There are also two optional resources covering networking issues and how to perform the above steps on Windows Subsystem Linux. In summary, these are useful for those who want to learn about Docker and how to use it to create containerized applications and services.
